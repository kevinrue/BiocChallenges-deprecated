## Notes

- Participants should already be familiar with some Bioconductor packages and their usage.
  Ideally, they would already have used the package in a workflow, and be willing to demonstrate their workflow, using a public dataset.
- This challenge naturally follows and complement the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ExperimentHub")` challenge, using an existing or new data set(s) in the workflow.
