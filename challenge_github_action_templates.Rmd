## Notes

- Prior participation in a workshop on GHA is recommended to participate in this challenge.
- As a pre-requisite to this challenge, the leader should set up a minimal package that would be used to test the workflows (note that there is another challenge that consists to write a minimal template Bioconductor package).
- It may be useful to set up the GHA cache before the session, to speed things up. Though conversely, it may be a good opportunity to teach people what the cache is and how to set it up. Also, setting up a the GHA cache means that a GHA workflow already exists (chicken and egg).
- Keep in mind that a GHA workflow can take 1h to run for a typical package (how much for a minimal package?)
