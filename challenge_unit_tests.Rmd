## Notes

- This challenge naturally follows and complements the challenge to [write a template software package](404.html).
- This challenge naturally precedes and complements the challenge to [write GitHub Action workflowa](challenge_github_action_templates.html) that automatically run the tests and upload code coverage to the codecov website).
- 'Code clinics' - participants can discuss their respective packages and learn from each other.
- Discuss best practices in writing unit tests. For instance, in code-driven development, tests are written before the code itself.
