## Notes

- Prior participation in a workshop on the use of the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ExperimentHub")` is recommended to participate in this challenge.
- Suggestions of data sets:
  + Mouse gastrulation data
  + Tabula Muris (adding Tabula Muris Senis)
  + Benchmarking study dataset (Lab of Holger Heyn, work presented last year by Elisabetta Mereu)
- Consider making a contribution to one of the packages that use the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ExperimentHub")`:
  + `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scRNAseq")`
  + `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("TenXPBMCData")`
